## Controls

By default, WASD is for joystick input, I O and P are the rotation buttons, Space is the hold button (for TGM3), and Enter is the Start button. I is also the Accept button in menus, and O is the button to back out. **If you want to change this before making a profile, enter a username of three spaces at the login screen (space character is back one) and change the bindings in the Preferences menu, and then back out to the Login screen.**

Starting up the game, after the Title Screen is the Login Menu. Left and right will change the current letter and Rotate 1 will advance a letter, while Rotate 2 will go back a letter. Once a three-letter profile name is selected, you will be moved to the main menu.

Games and modes are selected with the Rotate 1 button and backed out of with the Rotate 2 button. You can back out of the Game Select screen to the Login menu as well.

In the Mode Select screen, pressing the Hold button will show the Hiscores for the selected game's Master mode. **Note: this has not been updated in a while and may crash for some selected games.**
