##Controls

WASD is for joystick input, I O and P are the rotation buttons, K is the hold button (for TGM3), and Enter is the Start button.

Starting up the game, after the Title Screen is the Login Menu. Left and right will change the current letter and Rotate 1 will advance a letter, while Rotate 2 will go back a letter. Once a three-letter profile name is chosen, if it doesn't already exist, you will be asked to make a six-input password with your Rotate and Hold buttons. Hitting Start twice before entering any buttons will skip password creation, otherwise pressing start will move onto password verification and then the main menu.

If the profile name already exists, however, it'll simply ask for the password. This is different from the TGM3 profile system only in that only one profile can be made of any given name.

Games and modes are selected with the Rotate 1 button and backed out of with the Rotate 2 button. You can back out of the Game Select screen to the Login menu as well.

In the Mode Select screen, pressing the Hold button will show the Hiscores for the selected game's Master mode.
